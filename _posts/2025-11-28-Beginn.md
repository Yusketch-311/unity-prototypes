Over the past month, I've been working on a short essay titled "Head-Mounted Displays from a Social Philosophy Perspective." During this process, a question emerged: What is the relationship between "virtual" and "digital"? Both terms are often used as antonyms for words like "real" or "authentic," and are understood to possess artificial qualities that allow for replication and repetition—unlike irrepeatable, one-time reality. While I could understand how both virtual and digital are positioned against "lived, singular experience and reality," I remained uncertain about how to conceptualize the relationship between the two. Virtual and digital seem to differ in their essential nature, but how can this be explained through logic and evidence?

While pondering this question, I found helpful insights in the work of Brian Massumi, a Canadian philosopher. He writes that "nothing is more damaging to thinking and imaging the virtual than equating it with the digital" (1). If we can trace and clarify the logic underlying this proposition, the distinction between virtual and digital should become clearer.

When examining virtual and digital, I'd like to start by confirming the basic meanings of three concepts, including analog.

First, what is analog? Consider an analog clock: it represents the continuous flow of time through another continuous quantity—the angle of its hands. In other words, analog refers to a quality where information and states connect seamlessly in continuous fashion, changing smoothly. The essence of analog lies in "uninterrupted, continuous movement"—whether it's temperature gradually rising, timbre constantly shifting, imagination and thought flowing naturally, or bodily perceptions arising in chains.

Massumi offers a deeper explanation of analog's nature. According to him, analog refers to "the very movement of self-transformation." He suggests that the essence of analog is a mode of being that depends solely on its own transformation—like cloth that folds and unfolds. The "sensations" and "images" we experience also emerge as such analog transformations. Rather than fixed, clear forms, they are continuously changing "feelings" and "appearances"[^1].

More concretely, analog encompasses "continuous transformations that bridge different things"—like electricity becoming sound, heat converting to pain, or light becoming "vision." What the body feels—sensation and perception themselves—can be understood as chains of analog transformation. The body is a converter of things that connect continuously and change smoothly[^2].

On the other hand, what is digital? Digital is a method that converts information into discrete symbols or numbers like "0" and "1," processing them in stepped, discontinuous fashion. The digital world emphasizes combinations of states and choices—"what exists" and "which option to take." Various options are arranged in advance in ordered sequences, with programs created for each case. Digital processing organizes reality through frameworks of choices, probabilities, and quantities, dealing with possibilities like "what will happen next" and "how much of what will occur."

So what does virtual refer to? Virtual differs from both digital's "discrete symbols" and analog's "continuous change." Rather, virtual represents "power that hovers just before realization, where multiple possibilities coexist simultaneously in an undefined state." In music, for example, it's the "latent potential of sounds not yet played" before plucking a string; in writing, it's the "spreading of images" just before words take on meaning—fluid states that remain undetermined. While digital manages diverse possibilities within frameworks, virtual implies a multilayered state of potentiality prior to determination—"power that can emerge while remaining undefined."

The virtual cannot be directly grasped through the five senses. It emerges in the overlapping and intervals between images.

To grasp the image of the virtual, it's more important to focus on continuously changing flows and sampling-like perspectives that repeatedly capture moments, rather than attending to content or form. Virtual is not something that can be represented completely in fixed, isolated form—its essence lies in movement that oscillates between "inside" and "outside" [^3]. The most effective way to capture the virtual is to layer "moments" where images transform, repeatedly deform, and seem to disappear, without being bound by form or explanation. The process of images twisting and changing shape as they vanish—this is the most real manifestation of the virtual.

What's crucial is understanding that both analog's "qualitative change" and digital's approach to the world through "quantity" and possibilities are methods for engaging with the world. Methods that grasp the world through quantities, numbers, and symbols approach "reason as a tool." In contrast, analog's continuous change and chains connect to "generative reason"—more dynamic and creative modes of thinking like imagination and intuition.

Digital is a framework that uses numbers and symbols to organize choices and states, clearly indicating what will occur and to what extent. Virtual, by contrast, encompasses states and forces where multiple possibilities simultaneously lurk "without yet having form" and "invisible to the eye." If we equate virtual with digital, we lose the distinction between logical "possibility" and "potentiality" that has not yet fully emerged.

However, virtual and digital being different doesn't mean they exist in opposition, excluding one another. The medium connecting them is precisely analog. Massumi explains how digital and virtual are bridged and manifested through embodied activities like "reading words," "listening to music," and "surfing the internet." Through the act of reading, people sense digital text information as meaning through their bodies; sound signals are experienced as music with the body as converter. Virtual phenomena emerge through the intervention of such bodily qualitative changes (analog).

Thus, digital and analog are not fundamentally opposed; rather, analog is stimulated and activated by digital. And virtual is a phenomenon that appears in the overlapping, gaps, and ambiguous in-between of such doubled things. The substance of virtual is found precisely in the interaction between analog and digital, and in the foldings of body and sensation. Contemporary technology, particularly VR (Virtual Reality), attempts to technologically realize this vital model of "folding."
